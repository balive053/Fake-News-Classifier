# Fake-vs.-Real-News-Classifier

Fake News Classifier using a variety of classifiers (report)

This was designed as an NLP project to design and test a fake nes classifer on a limited number of real news sources. Dataset used was taken from two Kaggle fake vs real news datasets.

Results are used to show how achieving 99%+ accuracy on dataset X does not prove an effective classifer when exposed to dataset Y.
